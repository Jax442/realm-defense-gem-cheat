# Disclaimer:

(I think, haven’t fully tested other ways) this can only work by making a new account, because when you backup it doesn’t overwrite the save as more progress has been made on your current account in comparison to the new one. So you need to use a new google play account and make sure that’s the one being used by the game to login.  You can check this by going into your phone settings > Google > (Add/Select new account) > Ensure the box is ticked where it says “Use this account to sign in to games”


# What we're going to do:

Use bluestacks – which is a mobile emulator, root it and install game guardian and Realm defense version 1.11.1. We’re then going to run the game, do the first two tutorial levels then head over to the store. Click on the elixir tab open game guardian search for the value “:8500” and save all the addresses found. We will then select all these addresses and replace the value to “:-9999”. This will now give you gems when you click the button instead of take them away and it will also give you +10000 elixer, you can use an auto clicker to spam the button until you have around 5 million gems or however much you want. We will then backup our game and exit out of realm defense completely. Once that is done, we will head over to the play store and update the game to the latest version. You will now have a legit copy of the game with 5m gems and 50m elixir.
